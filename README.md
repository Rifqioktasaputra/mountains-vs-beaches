[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-app-url.streamlit.app)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a person prefers **Mountains** or **Beaches** for their vacation based on demographic information and personal preferences. Created as a final project for Data Science Batch 47 at Digital Skola.

## 🎯 Features

- Interactive web application built with Streamlit
- Predicts vacation preferences with high accuracy (87.57%)
- Uses XGBoost classification model
- Real-time predictions based on user inputs
- Confidence score for each prediction
- Visualized probability distribution

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing 52,444 records with the following features:

### Demographic Features:
- **Age**: Age of the individual
- **Gender**: Gender identity (male, female, non-binary)
- **Income**: Annual income in USD
- **Education Level**: Highest education attained
- **Location**: Type of residence (urban, suburban, rural)

### Travel Preferences:
- **Travel Frequency**: Number of vacations per year
- **Vacation Budget**: Budget allocated for vacations
- **Preferred Activities**: Activities during vacations
- **Favorite Season**: Preferred season for vacations

### Other Factors:
- **Proximity to Mountains**: Distance from nearest mountains (miles)
- **Proximity to Beaches**: Distance from nearest beaches (miles)
- **Pets**: Pet ownership (Yes/No)
- **Environmental Concerns**: Environmental awareness (Yes/No)

## 🤖 Model Performance

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 87.57%

## 📈 Model Development Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data distribution analysis
   - Feature correlation analysis
   - Target variable balance check

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Label encoding for ordinal features
   - One-hot encoding for categorical features
   - Feature scaling with StandardScaler

3. **Model Selection**
   - Compared 6 different algorithms
   - Selected XGBoost based on performance metrics
   - Cross-validation for robust evaluation

4. **Model Deployment**
   - Saved model using pickle
   - Created interactive Streamlit interface
   - Deployed on Streamlit Cloud
